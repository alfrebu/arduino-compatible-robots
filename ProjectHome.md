This project aims to collect a series of open source hardware pieces. The main goal is collecting at one place final design blocks of robots that are programmable with Arduino's IDE, thus Arduino Compatible Robots.

If you want to include your robot in this list, please become a project member (if you had issues let us know), create a new folder inside the main project area and upload your documentation there.

As documentation, avoid putting pictures inside the folders. Bring in your source: Eagle or KiCAD files, libraries for Arduino's IDE, 3D source files, etc. PDFs, image files, binaries, etc shouldn't be inside the control system and we should provide them only as downloads or embedded inside the documentation pages.

You are of course welcome to bring in robots that aren't yours, as long as it is not against the license protecting that robot.

Note that it is a condition of this project to share the code under GPLv3 and the design files as CC 3.0 BY-SA. If you aren't compliant with those rules for whatever reason, this is not your project.
