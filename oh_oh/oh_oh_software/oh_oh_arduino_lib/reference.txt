class FARO_Robot
must include Servo.h


	FARO_Robot():constructor
robot motion control
	forward():robot go forward
	backward():robot go backward
	left():robot turn left
	right():robot turn right
	stop():robot stop
	changeSpeed(int speed,int Wheel=3):change speed of wheels
		speed go from 0~255, have low speed threshold	wheel=1:left only, wheel=2:right only, wheel=3:both left and right

	these functions only need to be called once to perform a continous action

robot servo control
	getServo():initialize servo
	liftArm():servo lift up
	dropArm():servo drop down
	waveArm():servo go forward and backward for 3 turns(will pause program)
	
	Function called once to perform an action. See example Robot_Wave

robot light sensing
	followLight(): robot will follow light
	escapeLight(): robot will escape from light
	
	Need to be put in loop. See example Robot_Light

robot order list
	startRandomRun(): fill robot's order list with 100 random orders, go with run() to work
	stopRandomRun(): stop robot's random run action, go with run() to work
	run(): robot run according to its order list
	
	run() need to be put in loop. See example Robot_Sound






class SoundSwitch
	with sound detector pin connecting to analogIn 0
	
	SoundSwitch(int pin,int threshold=100):constructor
		pin shoud be 0, threshold is the noise threshold
	checkState():run every loop to get sound data
	isOn: true:switch is on(noise is high) false:switch is off(noise is low)
	isTurnningOn: only be true at the right time the switch is turned on
	isTurnningOff: only be true at the right time the switch is turned off
	
	See example Robot_Sound
